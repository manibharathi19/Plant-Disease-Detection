🌱 Plant Disease Detection
🚀 About the Project
Plant Disease Detection is a machine learning-based project that uses image classification to identify and diagnose diseases in plants. The model analyzes images of plant leaves and classifies them into different disease categories, helping farmers and gardeners detect issues early and take action to protect their crops. This system aims to improve agricultural productivity by providing easy-to-use and accurate disease identification tools.

🔧 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning model development)
OpenCV (for image processing)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Flask (for web framework to serve the model)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Machine Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the web interface)
Deployment: Heroku (or your chosen platform for hosting)
🌱 Features
Disease Detection: Identifies various plant diseases based on uploaded images of plant leaves.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple web interface for users to upload images and receive disease predictions.
Accurate Predictions: Powered by a trained deep learning model for high accuracy.
Multiple Disease Categories: Detects a variety of plant diseases across different plant species.
Model Retraining: Allows for periodic model updates and improvements using new datasets.
🧑‍💻 How to Run the Project Locally
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/manibharathi19/Plant-Disease-Detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Plant-Disease-Detection
Set up a virtual environment (Optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: env\Scripts\activate
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the dataset:

Ensure the dataset is in the correct directory, typically a folder with plant images and labels. If you don't have the dataset, you can use any suitable plant disease dataset, or follow the dataset instructions in the repository.
Train the model (if not pre-trained):

Run the following command to start training the model:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the web app:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the Plant Disease Detection web app.
📚 Usage
Upload an Image: Users can upload an image of a plant leaf affected by a disease.
Get Prediction: The model will analyze the image and return the predicted disease with an accuracy score.
View Results: The user can view the predicted disease name and description, along with suggestions for treatment or prevention.
💡 Future Improvements
Mobile Application: Build a mobile app for easier access and real-time image upload.
More Disease Categories: Expand the model to include more plant species and diseases.
Real-time Detection: Implement real-time video or camera-based disease detection for on-field use.
Integration with Agricultural Databases: Connect the model to external agricultural data sources for more precise predictions.
Automatic Disease Treatment Recommendations: Implement automatic suggestions for treatments based on the detected disease.
